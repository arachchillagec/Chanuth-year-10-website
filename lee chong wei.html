Lee Chong Wei was born on 21 
October 1982 in Bagan Serai,
 Perak, Malaysia. He grew up
  in a modest family, and his 
  parents encouraged him to
   play sports. At first, he 
   liked basketball, but his 
   mother guided him to badminton 
   because it was played indoors,
    safer from the hot sun. 
    From the age of 11, he trained 
    seriously, and his talent was
     quickly noticed. He joined
      the Bukit Jalil Sports School
       in Kuala Lumpur, where he
        developed into one of Malaysia top young players.
